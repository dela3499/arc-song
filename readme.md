The app will help a user upload a song, analyze it, and produce an arc chart like those in Martin Wattenberg's [Shape of Song](http://www.bewitched.com/song.html) project. 

The top-of-the-page link shows a mockup of the app. There are six screens, each with a different function. 

1. (Top-left) Landing page / upload song
2. (Top-middle) Play a song and note transitions between parts like bridge and chorus.
3. (Top-right) Group similar sections of the song (ie. put all the choruses in one group)
4. (Bottom-left) Listen to each section, and find the small, repeated musical phrases in it. 
5. (Bottom-middle) Group the similar musical phrases
6. (Bottom-right) Customize arc chart. Just prior to loading this screen, the arc diagram will be generated using information about the repetitions in the piece of music.
