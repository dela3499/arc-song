Thoughts on Angular: 

It seems that javascript is often made to interact with html through attribute directives. This practice expands the html and may make it difficult to read and change. 

Here are a few questions: 
1. What is the ideal way to structute document behavior? 
2. What abstractions should be used to construct an app, and how can these be built?
